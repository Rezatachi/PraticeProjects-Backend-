# Imagine getting tasked for a self-driving car

# In object-oriented, you would break up each component of the car into different parts. Camera, lane detection, and so on.

# An object would just combine an attribute and a method

# Split tasks to pieces

# How to use OOP

# Delegate tasks to other sections
# Waiter has attributes and methods

# An attribute
is_holding_plate = True
tables_responsible = [4, 7, 7]

# A method


def take_order(table, order):
    print(is_holding_plate)


def take_payment(amount):
    print(tables_responsible[0])


def carobectiverunhere():
    print()
# Object            Class


car = carobectiverunhere()
